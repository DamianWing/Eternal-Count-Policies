<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last updated: DATE</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>By using or inviting the Mercy Tracker Discord bot (“the Bot”), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you must remove the Bot from your server or stop using it.</p>

<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
<p>The Bot provides tools for tracking mercy counters, shard statistics, simulations, forecasting, and other gameplay‑related features for Raid: Shadow Legends. Some features may require a paid subscription through Discord’s native monetization system.</p>

<h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.</li>
  <li>You must not use the Bot for illegal, abusive, or harmful purposes.</li>
  <li>You must not attempt to exploit, reverse engineer, or disrupt the Bot.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Premium Features</h2>
<p>Premium features are provided through Discord’s official subscription and entitlement system. Access is granted only while an active subscription is maintained.</p>

<h2>5. Data Usage</h2>
<p>The Bot stores limited data such as user IDs, server IDs, shard counts, mercy values, and configuration settings. Details are provided in the Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>6. Availability</h2>
<p>The Bot is provided “as is” with no guarantee of uptime, accuracy, or uninterrupted service. Features may change or be removed at any time.</p>

<h2>7. Termination</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to remove access to the Bot for any user or server that violates these Terms or Discord’s policies.</p>

<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>The Bot is not affiliated with Plarium Global Ltd. All Raid: Shadow Legends trademarks belong to their respective owners. We are not responsible for any losses, damages, or issues arising from the use of the Bot.</p>

<h2>9. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions or requests, you may contact the developer through Discord.</p>
