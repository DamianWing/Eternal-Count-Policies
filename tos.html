<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last updated: DATE</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
  By using or inviting the Eternal Count Discord bot (“the Bot”, “the App”), you agree to these Terms of Service.
  If you do not agree, you must remove the Bot from your server or stop using it.
</p>

<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
<p>
  Eternal Count is a fan‑made Discord application that provides tools for manually tracking shard counts,
  mercy counters, event progress, and other gameplay‑related information for <em>Raid: Shadow Legends</em>.
  All features rely entirely on user‑provided data. The Bot does not interact with the game client, automate gameplay,
  or access any game account information.
</p>
<p>
  Some features may require a paid subscription through Discord’s official monetization and entitlement system.
</p>

<h2>3. Not Affiliated With Plarium or Discord</h2>
<p>
  Eternal Count is an independent, fan‑made tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to
  Plarium Global Ltd. All <em>Raid: Shadow Legends</em> trademarks belong to their respective owners.
</p>
<p>
  Eternal Count is also not created by, endorsed by, or partnered with Discord Inc. Use of the Bot must comply with
  Discord’s Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and Developer Policies.
</p>

<h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.</li>
  <li>You must not use the Bot for illegal, abusive, harmful, or disruptive purposes.</li>
  <li>You must not attempt to exploit, reverse engineer, or interfere with the Bot’s functionality.</li>
  <li>You must not use the Bot to automate gameplay or violate Plarium’s Fair Play policies.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for any data you submit through the Bot.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Onboarding, Usage Modes, and Visibility</h2>
<p>
  Eternal Count includes an onboarding process that allows you to configure:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Usage Mode</strong> — DM‑only, Guild‑only, or Both</li>
  <li><strong>Dashboard Visibility</strong> — Private (ephemeral) or Public</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Bot will enforce your chosen settings and may refuse commands in unsupported contexts.
</p>

<h2>6. Premium Features</h2>
<p>
  Premium features, if offered, are provided through Discord’s official subscription and entitlement system.
  Access is granted only while an active subscription is maintained. Refunds and billing are handled by Discord.
</p>

<h2>7. Data Usage</h2>
<p>
  Eternal Count stores only the data required to operate its features, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discord user IDs and server IDs</li>
  <li>Manually entered shard counts, mercy values, and event data</li>
  <li>User settings such as usage mode, visibility mode, and preferences</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Bot does <strong>not</strong> collect:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>game account information</li>
  <li>passwords or authentication data</li>
  <li>emails or payment information</li>
  <li>screen captures, memory data, or gameplay data</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For information on how Discord handles your data, refer to the Discord Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>8. Availability and Changes</h2>
<p>
  The Bot is provided “as is” with no guarantee of uptime, accuracy, or uninterrupted service.
  Features may change, be added, or be removed at any time without notice.
</p>

<h2>9. Termination</h2>
<p>
  We reserve the right to restrict or remove access to the Bot for any user or server that violates these Terms,
  Discord’s policies, or Plarium’s policies, or who misuses or abuses the Bot.
</p>

<h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
  Eternal Count and its developers are not responsible for any losses, damages, or issues arising from the use of the Bot,
  including but not limited to data loss, account issues, or consequences of violating Discord or Plarium policies.
